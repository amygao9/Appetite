# Team 31 - Appetite

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

- When: November 21 (requested and received 2 day extension)
- Where: Slack, online due to Covid-19

## Process - Reflection

### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- **Slack and organized communication:** having dedicated channels different tasks and parts of the project helped both separate and connect different parts of the app when necessary. Information, such as API keys, could be quickly found pinned in their respective channels, free from clutter from non-related areas of the project. Additionally, if a change or feature was needed by a team member, it was quick to determine who should be responsible for the changes and get in touch quickly, as well as any issues that may arise from such changes.
- **Notion task board:** continuing on with the theme of keeping everyone up to date, a task board on Notion helped keep track of which team member was working on which task. The only area this falls short is in the specifics, as it does not show exact progress on a feature, expected work remaining etc. shortfalls the Slack channel was able to cover.
- **Adaptability and collaboration**: Working online and across 3 time zones, the nature of our work needed to be fluid to accommodate every group member's schedules. Through successful communication over slack and calls, everyone collaborated to put put together a finished application. Whenever someone was blocked or stuck on an issue, many group members were willing to get on a call and help debug and pair program to determine the best course of action.
- **Constructive feedback across teams**: As we built out the application, constructive feedback is one of the key motivators to continually improve our own codability as well as the application itself. Whenever a new feature was pushed, we made sure that there is a corresponding Pull Request and get at least one other group member who was working on a similar feature to review before merging. This applies across teams as well, with requests from mobile and backend developers working alongside each other and providing feedback on UI components or REST API endpoints. This feedback loop lead to many discussions in order to determine the best course of action for the team, leading to a more performant application.

### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be, ordered from most to least important.

- **Prep-planned roles and tasks:** following the assignments in deliverable 1, each person was assigned a role (backend, frontend, devops etc) as well as roughly assigned tasks from the beginning. However, a combination of changes in members' schedules - notably due to exams and other assignments - and the ability of our members to pick up new technologies meant that actual development was far more fluid. This became apparent as a positive and negative; while we did not follow the originally planned roles, this allowed more group members to have visibility and tasks across all aspects of the codebase, resulting in more well-rounded developers.
- **Biweekly standups:** similarly to the previous point, this was a process related decision that works well in full time work environments, but unfortunately did not work well in a student environment. It was not uncommon for standups to be very short due to a lack of updates, such as right before a midterm exam. On the contrary, biweekly meetings were sometimes not frequent enough for all necessary discussion, although the Slack channel helped alleviate these issues. With most of our communication through Slack, daily updates were communicated on Slack channels.
- **Technical communication:** Due to the division of tasks into mobile and backend, the different schedules of the team members and assumed prior knowledge, there wasn't clear communication through the entire group for a multitude of different things, including setting up the project, any design changes made for our recommendation algorithm (had to reiterate it multiple times to each member so everybody understood) as well as any API changes such that the team members on mobile could integrate and start sending requests. Even though our Slack helped in attempting to mitigate that, just unclear communication mostly due to the online format of the project and inexperience working effectively as a team remotely, lead us to spend more time on certain tasks which could have been done in a quicker team.

### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any ordered from most to least important.

- **Fluidity:** Given the issues caused by roles and tasks which were set in stone early in the development phase of delivery 2, we will likely approach task assignment and roles with a more agile methodology.
- **Documentation:** as nice as the slack channel was to have, there was a general consensus that we were becoming a bit too reliant on it. One noticeable result of this was lazy documentation, as it was easy to simply ping whichever member worked on a feature and get help that way. For the next phase, our team intends to put a greater emphasis on documentation with the idea that documenting specifications, especially with regards to the REST API and request/response formats, which would have made the process of integrating frontend with backend.

## Product - Review

### Q4. How was your product demo?

*(Our group chose to work on an independent project and thus do not have a partner)*

Given that we were preparing a demo/documentation for an imaginary partner, we made made a set of recordings demonstrating the various features that would have been shown had we had a proper demo.

Additionally, since the product needs to be demonstrated to a less-technical audience, the demo was focused more on the user perspective and experience (think user stories from deliverable 1). Technical details were kept to a minimum, just enough to recreate and use the app themselves, with the belief that documentation would cover technical details and implementations in a handoff.

While there was no partner to accept or veto features, there were some feature decisions made within the team. The most obvious example of this was the planned ability for users to add each other as 'friends' and have these friends influence their recommendations; it was deemed too ambitious given the time frame, and its implementation was postponed to future deliverables to ensure the product we delivered for Q2 was bug-free.
